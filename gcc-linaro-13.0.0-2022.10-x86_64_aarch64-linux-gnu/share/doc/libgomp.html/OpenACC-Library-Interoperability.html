<span id="OpenACC-Library-Interoperability-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">9 OpenACC Library Interoperability</h2>

<span id="Introduction-1"></span><h3 class="section">9.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>The OpenACC library uses the CUDA Driver API, and may interact with
programs that use the Runtime library directly, or another library
based on the Runtime library, e.g., CUBLAS<a id="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>.
This chapter describes the use cases and what changes are
required in order to use both the OpenACC library and the CUBLAS and Runtime
libraries within a program.
</p>
<span id="First-invocation_003a-NVIDIA-CUBLAS-library-API"></span><h3 class="section">9.2 First invocation: NVIDIA CUBLAS library API</h3>

<p>In this first use case (see below), a function in the CUBLAS library is called
prior to any of the functions in the OpenACC library. More specifically, the
function <code>cublasCreate()</code>.
</p>
<p>When invoked, the function initializes the library and allocates the
hardware resources on the host and the device on behalf of the caller. Once
the initialization and allocation has completed, a handle is returned to the
caller. The OpenACC library also requires initialization and allocation of
hardware resources. Since the CUBLAS library has already allocated the
hardware resources for the device, all that is left to do is to initialize
the OpenACC library and acquire the hardware resources on the host.
</p>
<p>Prior to calling the OpenACC function that initializes the library and
allocate the host hardware resources, you need to acquire the device number
that was allocated during the call to <code>cublasCreate()</code>. The invoking of the
runtime library function <code>cudaGetDevice()</code> accomplishes this. Once
acquired, the device number is passed along with the device type as
parameters to the OpenACC library function <code>acc_set_device_num()</code>.
</p>
<p>Once the call to <code>acc_set_device_num()</code> has completed, the OpenACC
library uses the  context that was created during the call to
<code>cublasCreate()</code>. In other words, both libraries will be sharing the
same context.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    /* Create the handle */
    s = cublasCreate(&amp;h);
    if (s != CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;cublasCreate failed %d\n&quot;, s);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Get the device number */
    e = cudaGetDevice(&amp;dev);
    if (e != cudaSuccess)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;cudaGetDevice failed %d\n&quot;, e);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Initialize OpenACC library and use device 'dev' */
    acc_set_device_num(dev, acc_device_nvidia);

</pre></div>
<div align="center">Use Case 1
</div>
<span id="First-invocation_003a-OpenACC-library-API"></span><h3 class="section">9.3 First invocation: OpenACC library API</h3>

<p>In this second use case (see below), a function in the OpenACC library is
called prior to any of the functions in the CUBLAS library. More specificially,
the function <code>acc_set_device_num()</code>.
</p>
<p>In the use case presented here, the function <code>acc_set_device_num()</code>
is used to both initialize the OpenACC library and allocate the hardware
resources on the host and the device. In the call to the function, the
call parameters specify which device to use and what device
type to use, i.e., <code>acc_device_nvidia</code>. It should be noted that this
is but one method to initialize the OpenACC library and allocate the
appropriate hardware resources. Other methods are available through the
use of environment variables and these will be discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>Once the call to <code>acc_set_device_num()</code> has completed, other OpenACC
functions can be called as seen with multiple calls being made to
<code>acc_copyin()</code>. In addition, calls can be made to functions in the
CUBLAS library. In the use case a call to <code>cublasCreate()</code> is made
subsequent to the calls to <code>acc_copyin()</code>.
As seen in the previous use case, a call to <code>cublasCreate()</code>
initializes the CUBLAS library and allocates the hardware resources on the
host and the device.  However, since the device has already been allocated,
<code>cublasCreate()</code> will only initialize the CUBLAS library and allocate
the appropriate hardware resources on the host. The context that was created
as part of the OpenACC initialization is shared with the CUBLAS library,
similarly to the first use case.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    dev = 0;

    acc_set_device_num(dev, acc_device_nvidia);

    /* Copy the first set to the device */
    d_X = acc_copyin(&amp;h_X[0], N * sizeof (float));
    if (d_X == NULL)
    { 
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;copyin error h_X\n&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Copy the second set to the device */
    d_Y = acc_copyin(&amp;h_Y1[0], N * sizeof (float));
    if (d_Y == NULL)
    { 
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;copyin error h_Y1\n&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Create the handle */
    s = cublasCreate(&amp;h);
    if (s != CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;cublasCreate failed %d\n&quot;, s);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Perform saxpy using CUBLAS library function */
    s = cublasSaxpy(h, N, &amp;alpha, d_X, 1, d_Y, 1);
    if (s != CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;cublasSaxpy failed %d\n&quot;, s);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Copy the results from the device */
    acc_memcpy_from_device(&amp;h_Y1[0], d_Y, N * sizeof (float));

</pre></div>
<div align="center">Use Case 2
</div>
<span id="OpenACC-library-and-environment-variables"></span><h3 class="section">9.4 OpenACC library and environment variables</h3>

<p>There are two environment variables associated with the OpenACC library
that may be used to control the device type and device number:
<code>ACC_DEVICE_TYPE</code> and <code>ACC_DEVICE_NUM</code>, respectively. These two
environment variables can be used as an alternative to calling
<code>acc_set_device_num()</code>. As seen in the second use case, the device
type and device number were specified using <code>acc_set_device_num()</code>.
If however, the aforementioned environment variables were set, then the
call to <code>acc_set_device_num()</code> would not be required.
</p>

<p>The use of the environment variables is only relevant when an OpenACC function
is called prior to a call to <code>cudaCreate()</code>. If <code>cudaCreate()</code>
is called prior to a call to an OpenACC function, then you must call
<code>acc_set_device_num()</code><a id="DOCF4" href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>
